# Folding-Intubation-Box
This is a folding intubation box designed by [Vector Space](https://vector-space.org) in Lynchburg, Virginia.

This design is a reinterpretation of the [EmoTech Airway box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWDG0Pa2EK4&feature=youtu.be). It is constructed from 1/4" clear polycarbonate and uses PVC hinges in order to avoid any metal fasteners or parts that could be lost.
