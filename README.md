# Folding-Intubation-Box
This is a folding intubation box designed by [Vector Space](https://vector-space.org) in Lynchburg, Virginia.

This design is a reinterpretation of the [EmoTech Airway box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWDG0Pa2EK4&feature=youtu.be). It is constructed from 1/4" clear polycarbonate and uses PVC hinges in order to avoid any metal fasteners or parts that could be lost.

## Materials
- 4'x4'x3/16" polycarbonate
- 6' of pinless PVC hinge (https://www.mcmaster.com/11195a43)
- WeldOn #40 adhesive

## Instructions
This box has 5 major parts,
1. Front
2. Top
3. 2 sides
4. 2 glove flanges
5. 3 hinges

These boxes can be made with or without the use of CNC tools. If made using manual methods, it is recommended to print the templates for help with routing the handles and drilling the hand holes. Polycarbonate can be cut using traditional woodworking tools. It is recommended that they be made and assembled in the following order. Use the folding_intubation_box.pdf for dimensions.

1. Cut 4'x4' sheet in half, leaving two 2'x4' sheets.
2. Cut one of these halves into 24"x26" (front) and 24"x20" (side) pieces.
3. Cut the other half into a 24"x28" (top) and 24"x20" (side) piece.
4. Cut the front piece down to 21.5"x26".
5. Cut the top piece down to 20"x28".
6. Use drill template to drill two 5" hand holes in front piece using hole saw
7. Use handle template to route handles into the side panels
8. Glue side panels to front panel using hinges
9. Glue top panel to front panel using hinge
10. Glue glove flanges to front panel

## Cleaning
It is recommended that Polycarbonate be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol.
